# LinkedList-
LinkedList++ is a C++ Linked List template class library.
This is a simple plug and play library. There is no need to compile it using cmake or anything. Just include it in your code with correct path and create a class object and use it to store data in a linked list.

It has member function:
1. Add new nodes 
2. Return any node
3. Print Any node.
4. Delete any node.

One can simply access the nodes by providing the location of the element to a function which returns the variable stored in it.
In the library the counting starts from 1 and not from 0, thus making it less confusing.
